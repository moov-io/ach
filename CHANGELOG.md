## v1.4.0 (Released 2020-06-29)

Version v1.4.0 of ACH adds several notable features such as custom validation, a command-line tool `achcli` to describe files, and improvements for verifying NACHA compatibility on slightly malformed files. This release also contains enhanced testing and documentation improvements.

**Custom Validation**

The ACH library (and HTTP server) now supports custom validation with the [`ValidateOpts`](https://godoc.org/github.com/moov-io/ach#ValidateOpts) struct by calling `File.SetValidation(..)` and `Reader.SetValidation(...)`. This offers various options:

- `RequireABAOrigin bool`: Enable or disable routing number validation over the `ImmediateOrigin` file header field
- `BypassOriginValidation`: Skip validation for the `ImmediateOrigin` file header field and allow custom `TraceNumber` values
- `BypassDestinationValidation`: Skip validation for the `ImmediateDestination` file header field and allow custom `TraceNumber` values

The HTTP server also supports reading this struct with camel-cased names when calling the validation route.

**achcli**

`achcli` is a command-line utility for viewing ACH files in a more human readable format. This tool also allows masking `DFIAccountNumber` values with the `-mask` flag.

```
$ achcli -mask 20200601-1002-01.ach
Describing ACH file '20200601-1002-01.ach'

```

**Malformed Files**

ACH files with lines that are not 94 characters are now adjusted in-memory (missing or extra spaces) in an attempt to comply with NACHA standards. The underlying file on disk is not modified during this reading.
